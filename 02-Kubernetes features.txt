Features of Kubernetes

Automatic bin packing
It is about packaging of containers in bins (servers) in more effiecent way.

Service discovery and load balancing

Kubernetes wrap one or more containers into a high level structure called pod.
Many pods with same set of functions are wrapped inside a service. With this system, kubernetes can control the network and load balance it.

Storage orchestration
Containers inside pod need to store data. Each pod has a storage volume. Each storage volume is shared across all the containers in that pod.

Self healing

If container fails-----> restart the container
If node dies-----------> replaces and reschedule the containers in othe node
If container does not 
respond to user health
check----------------------->kills the container

Automated rollout and rollback
Kubernetes takes care of deploying changes in application or its configuration
or revert the changes and restore it to previous state automatically without any down time.

Secret and Configuration management

Secret is a sensitive data such as password, Secret is a kubernetes object that seperates sensitive data  from pods and container. Config Map is a kubernetes object that seperates configuration data from pods and container.

Batch execution
Kubernetes supports batch execution, long running jobs and replaces failed containers

Horizontal scaling
In kubernetes, we can scale up or scale down containers 
--using commands
--using dashboard
--automatically based on CPU usage
